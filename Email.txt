Hi name_of_manager,

 I have been working for Implementing deployment process for edgeapp using docker.I am new to environment and it took some time to workout on my proxy settings. Now, i have configured my proxy settings and it running fine now.
 
 I am looking forward to complete rest of the task. Also, I would like to inform you that as I am new to environment I need to go through all issues to get better understanding/control over our environment.
 
 I am running back and forth for my environment setup till now so it might take some more days to accomplish tasks that were assigned to me.
 
 Thanks,
 Shaul
